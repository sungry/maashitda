PROJECT MAASHITDA
  - Maashitda (Maa-shit-da) means 'tasty' in Korean although it might not seem that way. This is a prototype of a project which will search through a collection of restaurants from my own database by a keyword, and will display those restaurants that match the keywords.
  
How it works:
  - The technologies used in this project are angular.js, javascript, node.js and express.js, html and css. Angular works as the front-end framework which enables the app to be a single page app. node.js takes care of the back end side and express helps on the server side.  

How to contribute to it
  - If you have more data on restaurants, please let me know.
  
How to clone the repo and get it working in development
  - This is an open source project, simply fork this to your repo and clone it. Make sure you make your own branch of it.
  
What to expect in the future development
  - Using the Yelp API, it will have more comprehensive result display.
  - Using mongoDB, it will be a full MEAN stack functional app. 
  - User Authentication.
